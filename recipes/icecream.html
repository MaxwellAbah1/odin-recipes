    <h3> You will need</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>little Salt</li>
        <li>Egg yolks</li>
        <li>half and half milk</li>
        <li>Vanilla</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps in Prearing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the milk, salt, and half the sugar. 
            Stir the mixture constantly as you bring it just to a simmer (do not boil). Remove from heat</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and remaining sugar just until combined.</li>
        <li>To temper the eggs, slowly add 1/2 cup of the milk mixture in a drizzle into the egg mixture. 
            Do this slowly so as not to cook the eggs.</li>
        <li>Pour the entire egg mixture back into the saucepan with the milk mixture. Simmer over medium heat,
             about 3-5 minutes. Do not boil the mixture</li>
        <li>Remove the pot from the heat and let cool.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled custard mixture into a chilled bowl and refrigerate for about two hours until cold. 
            To avoid putting the hot mixture in the refrigerator, you can chill the bowl over another bowl filled 
            with ice for 10-15 minutes to cool it down first.</li>
        <li>When youre ready to churn the ice cream, add the half and half and vanilla to the custard mixture. Pour the mixture into your ice cream maker. 
            Churn until the ice cream is thick, per your ice cream makers instructions.</li>
    </ol>
